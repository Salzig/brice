= brice - Extra cool IRb goodness for the masses

== VERSION

This documentation refers to brice version 0.2.2


== DESCRIPTION

Enhances your IRb experience by adding new functionality and by providing
a framework that you can utilize to add your own extensions. It comes with
a set of pre-selected features (see the files in {lib/rc}[link:../lib/rc]),
but is highly configurable in that regard.

Add this to your <tt>.irbrc</tt> and receive the default goodness:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'brice/init'  # equivalent to: require 'brice'; Brice.init

Or get some more control over the configuration:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'brice'

  Brice.init { |config|
    ...
  }

See Brice::Config for what you can configure, and how.

It will even load your own extensions that you place in your <tt>~/.brice</tt>
directory. See Brice::DSL for helpers provided.

Please note that further changes to the configuration for brice can't be
guaranteed to have any effect after <tt>Brice.init</tt> has been called.
